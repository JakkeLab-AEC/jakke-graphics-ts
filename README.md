# jakke-graphics-ts

**jakke-graphics-ts** is a TypeScript library for advanced geometric and vector computations, designed for 2D and 3D graphics applications. It provides efficient algorithms and utilities for collision detection, line and polyline evaluation, bounding box calculations, and more.

## Features

- BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) tree structures for fast spatial queries
- Collision detection utilities for lines, triangles, and bounding boxes
- Comprehensive vector math functions (addition, subtraction, dot/cross product, normalization, rotation, scaling)
- Polyline and line evaluation tools for geometric analysis
- Type definitions for common geometric primitives (Line, Polyline, Triangle, BoundingBox, Vertex)
